<h2 id="mOverview">Overview of processing operations</h2><p>The following table summarises the types of data processed, the purposes for which they are processed and the concerned data subjects.</p><h3>Categories of Processed Data</h3>
<ul><li>Inventory data.</li><li>Contact data.</li><li>Content data.</li><li>Usage data.</li><li>Meta, communication and process data.</li><li>Log data.</li></ul><h3>Categories of Data Subjects</h3><ul><li>Users.</li></ul><h3>Purposes of Processing</h3><ul><li>Provision of contractual services and fulfillment of contractual obligations.</li><li>Security measures.</li><li>Organisational and Administrative Procedures.</li><li>Provision of our online services and usability.</li><li>Information technology infrastructure.</li></ul><h2 id="m2427">Relevant legal bases</h2><p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR: </strong>In the following, you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.</p>
 <ul><li><strong>Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)</strong> - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li><li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)</strong> - the processing is necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, do not prevail.</li></ul><p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations apply to data protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant legal basis according to the Swiss Data Protection Act: </strong>If you are located in Switzerland, we process your data based on the Federal Act on Data Protection (referred to as "Swiss DPA"). Unlike the GDPR, for instance, the Swiss DPA does not generally require that a legal basis for processing personal data be stated and that the processing of personal data is conducted in good faith, lawfully and proportionately (Art. 6 para. 1 and 2 of the Swiss DPA). Furthermore, we only collect personal data for a specific purpose recognizable to the data subject and process it only in a manner compatible with this purpose (Art. 6 para. 3 of the Swiss DPA).</p>
<p><strong>Reference to the applicability of the GDPR and the Swiss DPA: </strong>These privacy policy serves both to provide information pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms used in the GDPR are applied. In particular, instead of the terms used in the Swiss FADP such as "processing" of "personal data", "predominant interest", and "particularly sensitive personal data", the terms used in the GDPR, namely "processing" of "personal data", as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" are used. However, the legal meaning of these terms will continue to be determined according to the Swiss FADP within its scope of application.</p>

<h2 id="m27">Security Precautions</h2><p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
<p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.</p>
<p>Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect the data of users transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we employ TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information that is transferred between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby safeguarding the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions conform to the highest security standards. When a website is secured with an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being securely and encryptedly transmitted.</p>

<h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Retention and Deletion</h2><p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal regulations as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or no further legal bases for processing exist. This applies to cases where the original purpose of processing is no longer applicable or the data is no longer needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if statutory obligations or special interests require a longer retention or archiving of the data.</p>
<p>In particular, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons, or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or protection of the rights of other natural or legal persons, must be archived accordingly.</p>
<p>Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention and deletion of data specifically applicable to certain processing processes.</p>
<p>In cases where multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines for a date are specified, the longest period always prevails.</p>
<p>Data that is no longer stored for its originally intended purpose but due to legal requirements or other reasons are processed exclusively for the reasons justifying their retention.</p>
<p>Data Retention and Deletion: The following general deadlines apply for the retention and archiving according to German law:</p><ul> <li>10 Years - Fiscal Code/Commercial Code - Retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balance sheet as well as the necessary work instructions and other organisational documents (Section 147 Paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with Paragraph 3 of the German General Tax Code (AO), Section 14b Paragraph 1 of the German VAT Act (UStG), Section 257 Paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with Paragraph 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB)).</li><li>8 years - Accounting documents, such as invoices, booking and expense receipts (Section 147 Paragraph 1 No. 4 and 4a in conjunction with Paragraph 3 of the German General Tax Code (AO), Section 257 Paragraph 1 No. 4 in conjunction with Paragraph 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB))</li><li>6 Years - Other business documents: received commercial or business letters, copies of dispatched commercial or business letters, and other documents to the extent that they are significant for taxation purposes, for example, hourly wage slips, operating accounting sheets, calculation documents, price tags, as well as payroll accounting documents, provided they are not already accounting vouchers and cash register tapes Section (Section 147 Paragraph 1 No. 2, 3, 5 in conjunction with Paragraph 3 of the German General Tax Code (AO), Section 257 Paragraph 1 No. 2 and 3 in conjunction with Paragraph 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB)).</li><li>3 Years - Data required to consider potential warranty and compensation claims or similar contractual claims and rights, as well as to process related inquiries, based on previous business experiences and common industry practices, will be stored for the duration of the regular statutory limitation period of three years. This period begins at the end of the year in which the relevant contractual transaction took place or the contractual relationship ended in the case of ongoing contracts (Sections 195, 199 of the German Civil Code).</li> </ul>
<p>Data Retention and Deletion: The following general retention and archiving periods apply under Swiss law: </p><ul> <li>10 years - Retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balances, accounting vouchers and invoices, as well as all necessary working instructions and other organizational documents (Article 958f of the Swiss Code of Obligations (OR)).</li><li>10 years - Data necessary to consider potential claims for damages or similar contractual claims and rights, as well as for the processing of related inquiries based on previous business experiences and usual industry practices, will be stored for the statutory limitation period of ten years, unless a shorter period of five years is applicable, which is relevant in certain cases (Articles 127, 130 OR). Claims for rent, lease, and interest on capital, as well as other periodic services, for the delivery of food, for board and lodging, for innkeeper debts, as well as for craftsmanship, small-scale sales of goods, medical care, professional services by lawyers, legal agents, procurators, and notaries, and from the employment relationship of employees, expire after five years (Article 128 OR).</li> </ul>
<p>Start of the period at the end of the year: If a period does not expressly start on a specific date and lasts at least one year, it automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the time at which the termination or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.</p>

<h2 id="m15">Changes and Updates</h2><p>We kindly ask you to inform yourself regularly about the contents of our data protection declaration. We will adjust the privacy policy as changes in our data processing practices make this necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require your cooperation (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.</p>
<p>If we provide addresses and contact information of companies and organizations in this privacy policy, we ask you to note that addresses may change over time and to verify the information before contacting us.</p>

<h2 id="m42">Terminology and Definitions</h2><p>In this section, you will find an overview of the terminology used in this privacy policy. Where the terminology is legally defined, their legal definitions apply. The following explanations, however, are primarily intended to aid understanding.</p>
 <ul class="glossary"><li><strong>Contact data:</strong> Contact details are essential information that enables communication with individuals or organizations. They include, among others, phone numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses, as well as means of communication like social media handles and instant messaging identifiers. </li><li><strong>Content data:</strong> Content data comprise information generated in the process of creating, editing, and publishing content of all types. This category of data may include texts, images, videos, audio files, and other multimedia content published across various platforms and media. Content data are not limited to the content itself but also include metadata providing information about the content, such as tags, descriptions, authorship details, and publication dates. </li><li><strong>Controller:</strong> "Controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. </li><li><strong>Inventory data:</strong> Inventory data encompass essential information required for the identification and management of contractual partners, user accounts, profiles, and similar assignments. These data may include, among others, personal and demographic details such as names, contact information (addresses, phone numbers, email addresses), birth dates, and specific identifiers (user IDs). Inventory data form the foundation for any formal interaction between individuals and services, facilities, or systems, by enabling unique assignment and communication. </li><li><strong>Log data:</strong> Protocol data, or log data, refer to information regarding events or activities that have been logged within a system or network. These data typically include details such as timestamps, IP addresses, user actions, error messages, and other specifics about the usage or operation of a system. Protocol data is often used for analyzing system issues, monitoring security, or generating performance reports. </li><li><strong>Meta, communication and process data:</strong> Meta-, communication, and procedural data are categories that contain information about how data is processed, transmitted, and managed. Meta-data, also known as data about data, include information that describes the context, origin, and structure of other data. They can include details about file size, creation date, the author of a document, and modification histories. Communication data capture the exchange of information between users across various channels, such as email traffic, call logs, messages in social networks, and chat histories, including the involved parties, timestamps, and transmission paths. Procedural data describe the processes and operations within systems or organisations, including workflow documentations, logs of transactions and activities, and audit logs used for tracking and verifying procedures. </li><li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. </li><li><strong>Processing:</strong> The term "processing" covers a wide range and practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure. </li><li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Usage data refer to information that captures how users interact with digital products, services, or platforms. These data encompass a wide range of information that demonstrates how users utilise applications, which features they prefer, how long they spend on specific pages, and through what paths they navigate an application. Usage data can also include the frequency of use, timestamps of activities, IP addresses, device information, and location data. They are particularly valuable for analysing user behaviour, optimising user experiences, personalising content, and improving products or services. Furthermore, usage data play a crucial role in identifying trends, preferences, and potential problem areas within digital offerings </li></ul>
