You also have the option to create a custom exposure scenario. Simply add your own values for “events per year” and “volume per event in liters” for any of the exposures.

LRVs are determined by measuring pathogens (or indicator organisms) in the influent and effluent of the treatment step and calculating LRV by: <math display='block'><mrow><mi>LRV</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mfrac><mrow><mi>influent concentration</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>effluent concentration</mi></mrow></mrow></math> The QMRA tool includes a range of default LRVs derived from international guidance documents for both wastewater and drinking water technologies. For the most accurate results, consider using locally obtained removal values. The tool is highly customizable, allowing you to add your own treatments in the “New Treatment” tab on the right of the risk assessment configuration page, include non-technical barriers (e.g. hygiene practices), or even apply a negative LRV to simulate recontamination scenarios. Note: Click the “Save & Continue” Button and save your risk assessment before creating a new treatment.",
