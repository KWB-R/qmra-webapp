You also have the option to create a custom exposure scenario. Simply add your own values for “events per year” and “volume per event in liters” for any of the exposures.

The QMRA tool includes a range of default LRVs derived from international guidance documents for both wastewater and drinking water technologies. For the most accurate results, consider using locally obtained removal values.
